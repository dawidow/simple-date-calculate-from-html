# ðŸ‘‹ Hello world!

I have for you a mini application which after entering data in the html file and more specifically in the span with the attribute 'data-birthday' date of birth in the format Day / Month / Year will calculate how much you currently have. In the future I am going to develop this application in another project. Thank you for your attention

What it should look like?

``` <span data-birthday="Day/Month/Year" id="age"></span> ```

Download project as .zip and check it out.
